BFS:

queue: (all the courses which have no prerequisites thus to be taken in sequence)
indegree: the number of prerequisites this course has

Input: N, [[1,0]]

for N courses, each one has an indegree
1, go through the 2D array of prerequisites, and calculate the indegrees for all the courses;
2, add all courses into the queue with indegree 0
3, take each course on the queue one by one. After taking each one, minus the indegree for its successor course by 1: if the indegree of its successor courses become 0, add onto queue
4, check indegree, any course whose indegree not being 0 would not be able to be completed
