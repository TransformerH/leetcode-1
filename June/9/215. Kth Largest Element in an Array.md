2 ways to solve it:
1. quick select - recursive or non-recursive
2. priority queue

(Quicksort: pick a pivot, put all the ints smaller than pivot on the left, rest on the right..)


sol 1:
it is okay to select the left value as pivot, but most popularly a random one is selected

so first use a partition method to put all the ints larger than pivot at the left and all smaller at the right:
compare the pivot index with the K:
if pivot index + 1 == k then pivot is the one
else if pivot index + 1   >   k, go to left and do partitioning
else go to right and do partitioning
