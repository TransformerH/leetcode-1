MATRIX:
1 0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

DP:
1 0 1 0 0
1
1
1

when i = 0 or j = 0, the max possible square will only be 1 when the matrix[i][j] == '1'
starting from when i = 1 or j = 1:
e.g, when i = 1, j = 1:
if it's '0' here, then no square would be able to be formed;
else if it's '1', then a square of length 1 could be formed at least; if MIN of the left, up and left up (3 boxes) plus this 1 could be the max possible for when i = 1, j = 1;
if we traversal the whole matrix, the maximal possible square at each place could be decided. in order not to compute multiple times for each single place, we use dp[][] to do memorization.

finally, we use a integer called res to keep updating the max possible length at each place
return res * res;
